# Task 5 â€“ Crypto Portfolio Tracker

## Theory  
Tracking a crypto portfolio in real time requires fetching data from APIs, processing JSON, and automating updates. I used this theory to connect Google Sheets with the CoinGecko API via Apps Script, and build a dynamic tracker.

## What I Did  
- Created a Google Sheet with columns for Token Name, ID, Quantity, Price, and Value.  
- Wrote Apps Script code with functions such as `COINGECKO_PRICE()` to fetch live prices.  
- Set up formulas to calculate token value and total portfolio value.  
- Made the sheet public (view-only) and documented everything in GitHub.

## Learnings & Reflection  
- Learned to work with REST APIs in Google Apps Script.  
- Understood how to process JSON and integrate data into sheets.  
- Built a tool that anyone can use to monitor their crypto portfolio in real time.
